Q1. 0-1 Knapsack
Problem Description
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

NOTE:You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= C <= 10^3
1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^3

Input Format:
First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.

Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller
than or equal to C.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [60, 100, 120]
 B = [10, 20, 30]
 C = 50

Input 2:
 A = [10, 20, 30, 40]
 B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
 C = 10

Example Output
Output 1: 220
Output 2: 0


Example Explanation:-
Explanation 1:
 Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 100 + 120 = 220

Explanation 2:
 Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack
 therefore answer is 0.

        Recursive Solution for the Knapsack Problem.

        Intuition:
        - The recursive approach explores two choices for each item: including it or excluding it from the knapsack.
        - By considering all items, we can determine the maximum value subset within the given capacity.

        Time Complexity (TC):
        - The time complexity is exponential, O(2^N), where N is the number of items.
        - The number of function calls grows exponentially with the input size.

        Space Complexity (SC):
        - The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of items.
        - It is determined by the maximum recursion depth.

        Dynamic Programming Solution for the Knapsack Problem.

        Intuition:
        - The dynamic programming approach uses a 2D array to store and reuse intermediate results.
        - It iteratively calculates the maximum value for each item and capacity combination.

        Time Complexity (TC):
        - The time complexity is O(N * C), where N is the number of items and C is the knapsack capacity.
        - It performs calculations for each item and capacity combination once.

        Space Complexity (SC):
        - The space complexity is O(N * C), where N is the number of items and C is the knapsack capacity.
